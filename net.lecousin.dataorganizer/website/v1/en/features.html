<h1>Main screen</h1>
<p class="text_1">
<center><img src="screenshots/main_screen.gif"/></center><br/>
The application displays a window mainly split into 3 parts:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
 <li>On the left: a set of search criteria to filter the data displayed</li>
 <li>In the middle, on top: the list of data, filtered according to your search criteria</li>
 <li>In the middle, on bottom: the information about the selected data</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p class="text_2">
The search part allows you filtering the data diplayed.<br>
For each criterion you can either include the data corresponding to this criterion, 
or you can reverse the criterion and so exclude the data corresponding to this criterion.
</p>
<h3>By content type</h3>
<p class="text_3">
You can filter by content type, and for exemple to display only your videos.
</p>
<h3>By labels</h3>
<p class="text_3">
You can attach a list of labels to each of your data. For instance "Family", "Movie", "Humor"...<br/>
The labels are hierarchical: a label may contain sub-labels.<br/>
The labels allow you arranging your data in an efficient way: in a hierarchical way, but you can also, for a single data, attach labels to it from several levels of the hierarchy.
</p> 
<h3>Main criteria</h3>
<p class="text_3">
A set of criteria usable on every type of data allows you to quickly find your data:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
 <li>Name: to quickly search a data if you know part of its name</li>
 <li>Rate: to find data with a given range of note.</li>
 <li>Added: to find data you added within a given interval, i.e. the 2 last weeks.</li>
 <li>Opened: to find data you opened within a given interval, i.e. the last month.</li> 
</ul>
</p> 
<h3>Criteria by content type</h3>
<p class="text_3">
Finally, according to the content types you selected, additional criteria are displayed:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
 <li>Video: video duration, casting (search by actor, producer, director...)</li>
 <li>Audio: album name, artist, track name</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Data list</h2>
<p class="text_2">
The list of data displays the data corresponding to the search criteria.<br/>
This list may be displayed in a table (like above) or in a mosaic:<br/>
<center><img src="screenshots/mosaic.gif"/></center>
</p>

<h2>Data details</h2>
<p class="text_2">
When you select a data in the list, details on this data are shown.<br/>
This screen displays information like abstract of a movie, comments on it coming from Internet... 
It also allows you to see information about actors, producers, directors and writters. Indeed, when you click
on an actor you can create a data for this actor and then retrieve information about him from Internet. The
actor is then added to you data list and you can see his information:<br/>
<center><img src="screenshots/people.gif"/></center><br/>
Through this screen, you can navigate from link to link, from a movie to an actor, to another movie of this actor...
</p>

<h1>Open a data</h1>
<p class="text_1">
To open a data, you have several possibilities:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
 <li>To use another application installed on your computer</li>
 <li>To use the Media Player integrated to DataOrganizer:<br/>
 <center><img src="screenshots/mediaplayer.gif"/></center></li>
 <li>To use your TV:<br/>
 <center><img src="screenshots/sfr_mediacenter.gif"/></center><br/>
 For now only the NeufBox/SFRBox (french Internet provider) is supported (but for sure any contribution is more than welcome ;-)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Add data</h1>
<p class="text_1">
To add data, it is very easy: either you select the data to add by yourself, or
you ask to analyze a folder (and sub-folders) to automatically detect your data:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
 <li>Video: DataOrganizer automatically find your video files, and create a new data for each of them</li>
 <li>Audio: DataOrgniazer is able to automatically find music albums and their information:
  <ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
   <li>Analyze information from each file (album name, artist, track number...)</li>
   <li>Analyze playlist files to know the track order if necessary</li>
   <li>If the track order cannot be determined by the previous information, DataOrganizer tries to find it thanks to the file names</li>
   <li>If pictures are present, DataOrganizer can attach them to the album (cover, concert photos...)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
You can also add data you do not have by retrieving information from Internet. This is especially usefull if you want to have data on actors (who doesn't correpond to a file on your computer).
